# Randomness drawing

App to draw abstract scenes using variety of settings, utilising the beauty of controlled randomness.
Allows you to specify algoritm of drawing.

General flow is like following:
1. You choose how many shapes you wanna draw
2. You customize sizes, positions, colors of shapes.
3. You hit draw and everything is drawn according to settings.

So called "Modulators" (term taken from synthesizers world, where you can modulate different parameters) are in the heart of app.
For example, there is "Noise" modulator. It's being called on each shape, and you can allow how much it will modulate each shape. Modulators can modulate each other, too. Also there are different types of modulators too. 

Also some features like drawing custom shapes, drawing custom shapes using vertexes, different positioning algoritms, like "biased" to some point, or spiral position algoritm.
Positioning shapes in a grid manner and later modulating their positions, too. And many more. Presets are saveable.
